# hello_world
just another repository
something changed in a way I dont know generate a bug
should I stay or should I go
and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes 
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon 
please dont put your life on the hands of a rock'n roll band who'll throw it all away
how dose it feel? like a rolling stone
